## Questions  

Here are sample questions from former exams. In many instances, other examiners would comment they had similar or even identical ones. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

qs <- read_csv("data/qs.csv") %>% 
  mutate(rep = row_number()) %>% 
  select(rep, everything())

qs %>% 
  select(-id) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

summary <- qs %>% 
  group_by(typology, category) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

ggplot(summary, aes(typology, n, fill = category)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")

```
